Only projects that involve the local population in the decision making process receive the Gold Standard certificate. Moreover, the certification proves that the projects are real additional projects that would not have happened otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe carbon positive calculation\r\n\r\nUnder this framework, the carbon captured by this cocoa forest is determined on a regular basis, with an impressive result: 0.412 kilogramme of CO2 are captured for each 50 gramme chocolate bar.
