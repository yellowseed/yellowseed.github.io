            The value of direct connection is both economic and social. We avoid profit-draining supply chains and intermediaries, helping both us producers and the final consumers. We feel increasingly motivated to not only improve the quality of our product, but our quality of life. In this way, the producer is part of the winning team, and the entire machine runs with more power and efficiency.

            As the global community of small chocolate makers continues to grow, so does the need for small quantities of unique and high quality beans. Finding those beans and building relationships with producers and fermentaries is one of the most important things we do, but it's expensive and time consuming. Yellow Seed is coordinating a movement that connects buyers and producers, solving a problem that so many makers don’t have the time or resources to solve.

      Though I do not believe that a plant will spring up where no seed has been, I have great faith in a seed. Convince me that you have a seed there, and I am prepared to expect wonders.
